# This is a calendar for showcase reasons

##Contains:
* usage of the react-starter-kit repository (one of my other stuffs)
* a paginated calendar

This will install the dependecies and start a webpack-devserver at http://localhost:8080.

## Getting things ready
```npm install```
```npm start```

this will start the development server

http://localhost:8080 will automatically redirect you to today's date.

## Side Notes
* The project doesn't make much use of Redux, and Redux-Observables, since everything is done with routing.
* Recompose is widely used though
* The build environment is pretty much the latest possible one.
* The project also uses react-loadable, even if its not that widely used.
